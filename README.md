# Tutorials
This repository contains tutorials for Python and its extension libraries. These tutorials are designed to give you a working understanding of Python for test automation. The tutorials are exhaustive, but should give you everything you need to read my scripts, edit them, and even write your own.

The ["Getting Started" notebook](https://github.com/ddewitt9/Tutorials/blob/master/Getting%20Started.ipynb) has instructions on how to install and configure Python. Once you've done so, download the notebook itself and run it locally to get a feel for the language itself.

The ["Extension libraries" notebook](https://github.com/ddewitt9/Tutorials/blob/master/Extension%20Libraries.ipynb) is still a work in progress, but has information on utilizing Matplotlib and PyVISA.

Don't hesitate to contact me with questions, comments, and suggestions.
