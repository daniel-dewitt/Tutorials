    "## Why Python?\n",
    "Python is the programming language of choice for many scientists because it offers a great deal of power to analyze and model data with relatively little overhead in terms of learning, installation, or development time. It is a language you can pick up in a weekend, and use for the rest of your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This quick start guide and quick reference is an Interactive Python notebook, or IPython notebook. These files can host a range of text formatting, data visualization, and executeable code in a unified and embedded format. You can open and run this file yourself to run the code within and play around with the examples. But first, let's install Python"

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two branches of current releases in Python: the older-syntax Python 2, and the newer-syntax Python 3. The things you can accomplish with the two are largely the same, but support is slowly being phased out for Python 3, so I write these notes with Python 3 in mind. This is the version of the language I use day-to-day and am most comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, these notes assume you have a Python distribution that includes the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IPython**, with the additional libraries required for the notebook interface;\n",
    "* **Numpy**, the core numerical extensions for linear algebra and multidimensional arrays;\n",
    "* **Scipy**, additional libraries for scientific programming;\n",
    "* **Matplotlib**, excellent plotting and graphing libraries;\n",
    "* **Pandas**, Excel-like data handling and parsing;\n",
    "* **PySerial**, the serial port I/O library for I2C communication;\n",
    "* **PyVISA**, the GPIB I/O library for instrument control.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may choose any distribution of Python you prefer, but I recommend and personally use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/?lang=en-us) distribution. It comes with all of the above packages preinstalled with the exception of PyVISA. If you choose a different distribution, be sure to install the above packages before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you chose the Anaconda distribution, you can install PyVISA by opening the \"Anaconda Prompt\" application to open the Anaconda command line, and run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge pyvisa\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install PyVISA to your Anaconda environment. If you used a different distribution, you can install PyVISA and all other packages using pip."

    "# I. Python Overview\n",
    "This is a quick introduction to Python. The goal of this notebook is to give you a quick and functional understanding of the language and what it's doing. It also introduces IPython notebooks: this is one! There are abundant resources available for learning the language with greater depth, so don't hesitate to augment this notebook with additional resources from around the web. Python is extremely well-documented and most questions can be answered in one or two Google searches. I design this notebook to be comprehensive, so feel free to browse my test automation scripts as soon as you get some familiarity with the language. The scripts themselves are commented and documented as well. Don't forget that I maintain and support this notebook, so let me know if any areas need fleshing out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, notebooks have code cells (that are generally followed by result cells) and text cells. The text cells are the stuff that you're reading now. The code cells start with \"In [ ]:\" with some number generally in the brackets. If you run the code in a cell, the code will run in the Python interpreter and the result will print out in the output cell. You can then change things around and see whether you understand what's going on. If you need to know more, see the [IPython notebook documentation](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) or the [IPython tutorial](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html).\n",

Pressing the stop button beside it will terminate a currently running cell. The plus button adds a code cell below the current one. You can browse keyboard shortcuts for these and other commonly used commands by navigating to Help > Keyboard Shortcuts.
